            {{ site.title }} is committed to creating a conference that is as inclusive as possible.

            We are also committed to ensuring the conference is a place
            where ideas are exchanged, old friends get together, new friends meet and <strong>harassment
            is not tolerated</strong>. We expect speakers, attendees and sponsor representatives to be
            professional and courteous to each other. We reserve the right to remove, without refund,
            ANY attendee (speaker or otherwise) who is unable to adhere to this policy. All speakers are expected to adhere to the <strong><a href = "http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2016-chicago/conduct/" style="color:white;">Code of Conduct</a></strong>.
